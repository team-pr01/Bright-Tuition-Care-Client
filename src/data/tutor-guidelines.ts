        "Passion is key to effective teaching, even if you lack experience. Many guardians prefer tutors with experience, but an engaging teaching method is paramount.",
        "Communicate openly with parents, especially if the student is not responsive. Avoid raising your voice, as many guardians prefer a calm approach.",
        "Maintain consistency with your tutoring schedule. Frequent changes may cause guardians to perceive you as unreliable.",
        "Build rapport with your students. A friendly relationship encourages students to ask questions and engage more deeply in lessons.",
        "Encourage students to participate actively, such as reading questions aloud to develop verbal and comprehension skills.",
        "When attention wanes, consider switching subjects or offering short breaks to rejuvenate focus. If a break feels too long, engage the student in light conversation about their day.",
